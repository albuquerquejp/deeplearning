# deeplearning
In this repository I will share my theoretical and practical advances regarding deep learning/machine learning.

Here I will post all notebooks referring to tasks developed during the course "Deep Learning Integrated Course Program", by DeepLearning.AI/Coursera. The program consists of 5 courses that will help understand the capabilities, challenges, and consequences of deep learning and prepare to participate in the development of leading-edge AI technology, as informed by them in the program description.
